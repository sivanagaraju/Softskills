## ❓ Monthly Reflection Prompts

Set a reminder on the 1st of each month. Answer one per month, cycling through:

**Month 1:**
> *"Which of my strengths did I use most this month? Was I in flow when I used it, or did it feel forced?"*

**Month 2:**
> *"What limit surprised me this month — something I thought I'd handled but showed up again?"*

**Month 3:**
> *"What feedback did I receive this quarter? Did it match my self-view or reveal a blind spot?"*

**Month 4:**
> *"What % of my time am I spending in my Zone of Genius vs. Zone of Competence vs. Zone of Incompetence?"*

**Month 5:**
> *"Is there a strength I'm overusing? What situation this month called for less of my signature style?"*

**Month 6:**
> *"Name one limit I've actively worked on this half-year. What's the measurable change?"*
