# ⚠️ Common Mistakes — Knowing Your Strengths and Limits

---

## Overview

The mistakes below are particularly common among high-performing professionals who take their development seriously. They are mistakes of *misclassification and overconfidence* — errors in how self-knowledge is built and maintained, not failures of intention.

| # | Mistake | Root Cause | Core Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Treating competencies as strengths | Conflating "I'm good at this" with "this is a true strength" | Builds career around draining work |
| 02 | Not seeking Blind Spot feedback | Assuming self-report is sufficient for self-knowledge | Unmanaged impact on others; career derailers unaddressed |
| 03 | Treating all limits as skill gaps | Default assumption: "I just need more training" | Wrong solution applied; limits worsen or persist |
| 04 | Avoiding limits entirely | Treating limits as permanent verdicts rather than data | Never discovers what can be expanded |
| 05 | Overusing a strength in every context | "If it works, use it more" | Strength becomes liability; relationship damage |
| 06 | Updating the self-map once and stopping | Treating identity as fixed rather than evolving | Using an outdated map in new territory |
| 07 | Discounting positive feedback | "They're being kind; I don't fully believe it" | Systematically underestimates actual capability |
| 08 | Confusing role requirements with personal limits | "My job requires this" taken as "I should be good at this" | Self-image distorted by context rather than character |

## Mistake 01 — Treating Competencies as Strengths

### Why Smart People Make This Mistake

"Strengths" is not a technical term in common usage. When managers ask "What are your strengths?" in interviews, they mean "What are you competent at?" This creates a language problem: people list competencies (things they can do well) as strengths (their energising, authentic performance zones) — and then build career plans around competencies that aren't necessarily sustaining them.

### The Diagnostic

Ask yourself about your currently listed "strengths":

> "After doing this for a full day — am I typically more energised or more depleted?"

If the answer is "depleted, but it's fine — I do it well," this is a **learned competency**, not a true strength.

### What This Costs

Building a career role centred on learned competencies (rather than true strengths) produces chronic low-grade depletion. The person is technically performing — work quality may even be high — but they are running a weekly energy deficit that compounds over years. This is a primary factor in professional burnout among high-achievers: they were excellent at something that wasn't actually their strength, and they didn't recognise the distinction until the burnout was advanced.

> 📊 **Research — Harter, Schmidt & Hayes (2002), "Business-Unit-Level Relationship Between Employee Satisfaction, Employee Engagement, and Business Outcomes," Journal of Applied Psychology:** Gallup's large-scale meta-analysis found that employees in roles aligned with their strengths showed 23% higher productivity on average and reported significantly higher engagement. The effect was not explained by competence alone — role alignment with energising activities was the key variable.

### The Language Fix

Change how you answer the strengths question:

- Not: "I'm good at [X]"
- But: "I consistently perform at a high level AND I find this genuinely energising: [X]"

The second formulation names a true strength.

## Mistake 02 — Not Seeking Blind Spot Feedback

### Why Smart People Make This Mistake

Asking for honest feedback on your blind spots requires vulnerability that runs counter to professional identity management. In professional settings, you are expected to have self-awareness — asking for it admits you might not. And there's genuine risk: what if you hear something uncomfortable, or something you can't easily fix?

The result: most professionals rely almost entirely on self-report for self-knowledge — which Dunning and Kruger's research confirms is systematically unreliable.

### The Real Cost

Your blind spot patterns are not invisible to the people around you. They are fully visible — and they are shaping how people experience working with you every single day. What you don't see is not therefore absent; it is simply unmanaged.

The most common derailers in mid-career leadership — the behaviours that prevent promotion, damage teams, and erode trust — are almost universally blind spots. They are not things people would have chosen to do if they could see them clearly.

> 📊 **Research — McCall, Lombardo & Morrison (1988), "The Lessons of Experience":** A landmark Center for Creative Leadership study found that leaders who derailed (were terminated, demoted, or plateaued unexpectedly) were most commonly derailed not by lack of skill but by interpersonal blind spots: arrogance, insensitivity to others, failure to build relationships, inability to adapt to differences in style. These patterns were consistently present and visible to colleagues before the leaders themselves recognized them.

### The Diagnostic

Ask yourself: When was the last time you specifically requested feedback on how you impact others? If the answer is "in my annual performance review" or "I can't remember," you are operating with an under-maintained self-knowledge map.

## Mistake 03 — Treating All Limits as Skill Gaps

### The Default Assumption

The default corporate response to any identified limit is: training. Can't do X? Take a course. Not confident in Y? Workshop. Struggling with Z? Coaching to develop the skill.

This is the right response for skill gaps. It is the wrong response for energy drains and values conflicts.

### Why the Wrong Solution Fails

- **For an energy drain:** Training makes you more proficient at an energy-draining task. You are now a more skilled version of someone doing work that depletes them. The drain often persists or worsens.
- **For a values conflict:** Training doesn't address the identity or moral dimension. The person completes the training and still finds themselves resistant, avoidant, or resentful — now with additional frustration that the "fix" didn't work.

### The Diagnostic Test

Before assigning or accepting any development intervention for a limit, run the three-diagnostic-question framework:

> 1. "Could I get significantly better at this with focused effort?" → YES = Skill Gap → Training
> 2. "When I do this well, am I still depleted?" → YES = Energy Drain → Delegation/redesign
> 3. "Is my resistance moral, identity-based, or 'fundamentally wrong for me'?" → YES = Values Conflict → Honest naming + role conversation

| Correct Typing | Right Response | Wrong Response (Common Error) |
|---|---|---|
| Skill Gap | Training, deliberate practice, mentoring | Telling the person to "just delegate" — they aren't yet capable enough |
| Energy Drain | Delegation, role redesign, minimisation | Sending to training to be "better at" the draining task |
| Values Conflict | Direct conversation, role alignment, or exit | Telling the person they need to "get comfortable with it" |

## Mistake 04 — Avoiding Limits Rather Than Engaging Them

### Why This Happens

Limits feel threatening to professional identity — especially for high-achievers whose identity is built on being capable. Acknowledging a limit means acknowledging that you're not operating at a high level in some dimension. This can be avoided by staying in the comfort zone of established strengths and steering away from any context that would expose a limit.

### The Career Cost

Limits that are avoided are never correctly typed. They remain ambiguous — is this skill gap, energy drain, or values conflict? Without typing, no appropriate response can be designed. And avoidance often prevents the discovery that what felt like a limit was actually a **developing strength** — a capability that would have become energising with sufficient practice and early scaffolding.

> 📊 **Research — Dweck (2006), "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success":** Dweck's growth mindset research consistently found that people with fixed mindsets (who believe capabilities are given, not grown) avoided challenges that might expose their limits. This avoidance prevented the development of new strengths and the accurate identification of actual limits. The avoidance itself created the capability stagnation.

### The Distinction That Matters

| Contact With Limits | Avoidance of Limits |
|---|---|
| "This is hard for me — let me understand why, type it correctly, and respond appropriately" | "This is hard for me — I'll find a way to not do this" |
| Produces accurate self-knowledge over time | Produces inaccurate, incomplete self-knowledge |
| Occasionally discovers developing strengths | Never does |
| Enables appropriate role design | Enables role over-restriction |

## Mistake 05 — Overusing a Strength Across All Contexts

### The Trap

Strengths feel good to use. When something works, the natural impulse is to use it more. But every strength has a context in which it becomes counterproductive — when the unique value it offers in one setting becomes a liability in another.

The person who built their reputation on analytical rigour starts applying that rigour to brainstorming sessions where generative thinking is needed. The decisive leader applies decision-speed to situations that require deliberate stakeholder consultation. The empathic team member absorbs team anxiety to the point of being paralysed by it.

### The Quadrant That Matters (Expanded)

| Deployment | Result |
|---|---|
| Right strength, right context | Maximum value produced |
| Right strength, wrong context | Good execution of the wrong thing; sometimes counterproductive |
| Overused strength, right context | Initially useful; starts to crowd out other necessary approaches |
| Overused strength, wrong context | Active liability — the strength itself creates the problem |

### The Signal to Catch

> "Has anyone suggested my [strength] is 'too much'?" or "Have I noticed relationships feeling strained in situations where I was using my primary strength most heavily?"

A "yes" to either is the signal that the shadow has appeared.

## Mistake 06 — Updating the Self-Map Once and Stopping

### The Fixed Self-Image Error

Many people do one round of strengths identification (a VIA survey, an assessment, a coaching engagement) and file the results under "my strengths and limits." They then carry that snapshot forward for years — sometimes decades — as the current, accurate picture.

This is a map maintenance failure. You change. Your contexts change. Strengths that were genuinely true at 25 — fuelled by an earlier life chapter, a particular role, a certain kind of energy — may not be the same at 40. Limits that were real may have been expanded through sustained engagement. New strengths may have emerged from contexts you hadn't yet encountered.

### The Update Schedule

A sustainable self-knowledge maintenance schedule:

| Review Type | Frequency | What It Involves |
|---|---|---|
| Energy Audit | Quarterly | 2-week observation period; check alignment between strengths and current role |
| Blind Spot refresh | Annually | Short informal 360° — 3–4 questions to 4–5 people |
| Strengths re-evaluation | Every 2–3 years | Full VIA + energy audit + major life/role transitions |
| Values re-examination | At major life transitions | When role changes significantly or after major events |

## Mistake 07 — Discounting Positive Feedback

### The Systematic Negative Effect

Many people — particularly those with imposter syndrome patterns (see Concept 03) — apply asymmetric credibility standards to feedback: critical feedback is treated as accurate data; positive feedback is explained away ("They're being kind," "They don't see what I'm really doing," "That was a fluke").

This asymmetry systematically underestimates actual capability and blocks accurate self-map maintenance.

### The Calibration Standard

Apply the same credibility standard to positive and negative feedback:

> "If this same person gave me critical feedback, would I take it seriously as data? Then I must apply the same standard to their positive feedback."

Documenting positive feedback (the Wins Archive practice from Concept 03) is specifically designed to force engagement with positive evidence that would otherwise be dismissed.

## Mistake 08 — Confusing Role Requirements With Personal Limits

### The Environment-Person Confusion

Not everything that is difficult in your current role is a personal limit — some of it is a mismatch between the role's requirements and your strengths. This distinction is critical for accurate self-mapping.

> **Role Requirement:** "My current role requires detailed stakeholder reporting. I don't enjoy this."
> **Accurate framing:** "Detailed stakeholder reporting is an energy drain for me — it's in my Drain column. Whether this is a 'limit' depends on whether I need to develop it further or find a role where this isn't a weekly requirement."

> **Mistaken framing:** "I'm not good at stakeholder management." (Global identity statement from a role-context observation)

The environment shapes behaviour. Drawing conclusions about permanent personal limits from one role's demands is overextension of the evidence. The correct conclusion is more specific: "In *this* role, *this* particular demand is a drain for me. That tells me about the fit between this role and my strengths — not necessarily about a universal personal limit."
