# 🏋️ Practice Exercises — Knowing Your Strengths and Limits

---

## How to Use These Exercises

Work through these exercises in order — each builds on the previous. Exercises 01–03 can be done independently and in Week 1. Exercises 04–06 require external input (feedback from others), so build in 1–2 weeks for collection. Do not skip to Exercise 05 without completing the data collection in Exercise 03.

## Exercise 01 — 🔍 The Strength Identification Deep Dive

### Goal

Move beyond surface-level "I'm good at presentations" to identify your true signature strengths — activities where performance, energy, and authenticity all converge.

### Why This Exercise Exists

Most strengths lists are really **competency lists** — things you can do well. This exercise filters for **true strengths**: activities that also energise you and feel authentically like you. The distinction changes development planning entirely.

### Instructions (45 minutes)

**Step 1 — The Activity Recall (15 min)**
Think back across your professional history (last 3–5 years). List 8–10 moments or activities where you felt:

- Fully absorbed in the work
- Noticeably more energised during or after
- "This is exactly what I should be doing right now"
- Like the "best version of yourself"

Write them as brief descriptors: "Debugging the complex API issue," "Leading the workshop with the client team," "Writing the strategy memo," "Mentoring the junior hire."

**Step 2 — The Pattern Extraction (15 min)**
For each activity, identify: *what was I actually doing at the core of this?*

| Activity | Core Action | VIA Strength Category (guess) |
|---|---|---|
| Debugging the complex API issue | Analysing a puzzle, finding a root cause | Curiosity, Love of Learning |
| Leading the workshop | Facilitating group thinking, holding space | Leadership, Social Intelligence |
| Writing the strategy memo | Making complex ideas clear and structured | Creativity, Judgment |
| Mentoring the junior hire | Helping someone see what they can become | Kindness, Perspective |

**Step 3 — The Three-Filter Test (15 min)**
For your top 5 patterns, apply the three-criteria test:

| Strength Candidate | Performance (High/Medium/Low) | Energy (Energising/Neutral/Draining) | Authenticity (Real you/Performed) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | ✅ True Strength / ⚠️ Learned Competency / 🔶 Developing |
| | | | | |

**Step 4 — The VIA Verification**
Take the VIA Survey ([viacharacter.org](https://www.viacharacter.org)) if you haven't yet. Compare your top 5 VIA results to your patterns from Step 2. Note where they align and where they diverge.

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

> *"My three-filter test revealed: I thought 'presenting to executives' was a strength. Energy filter caught it — I'm drained after every senior presentation, even when I do well. Verdict: Learned Competency. I'm good at it. It's not a strength. What actually passed all three filters: facilitated problem-solving in small groups (high performance, reliably energising, feels most like me). That's a true strength — and my current role gives me maybe 5% of my week doing it."*

## Exercise 02 — ⚡ Two-Week Energy Audit

### Goal

Build an empirical, observation-based picture of which tasks energise and which drain you — replacing retrospective impression with systematic real-time data.

### Setup (Before Week 1 Starts)

Create a log in any format — phone notes, Notion table, or paper journal divided into two columns: *Task* and *Energy After (E = Energised / N = Neutral / D = Drained / SD = Significantly Drained).*

Optional: add a 5-word "why" note (e.g., "SD — repetitive, no thinking," "E — solved something hard").

### During the Two Weeks (3× daily)

After every significant work block (not every 5 minutes — after meaningful chunks of work), record the task and its energy impact. Takes approximately 15 seconds each time.

Set a phone reminder for 10 AM, 2 PM, and 5 PM if helpful.

### Week 2 Analysis (30 minutes)

**Part A — Frequency count**

| Energy Level | Number of Work Blocks | % of Total | Most Common Task Types |
|---|---|---|---|
| Energised (E) | | | |
| Neutral (N) | | | |
| Drained (D) | | | |
| Significantly Drained (SD) | | | |

**Part B — The Pattern Questions**

1. What do your TOP 5 most-energising tasks have in common? (Type of work? Who you work with? What skill is being used? Level of complexity? Autonomy?)

2. What do your TOP 5 most-draining tasks have in common? (Same questions.)

3. What percentage of your week is currently in the Drained or Significantly Drained category?
   - Under 15%: Healthy
   - 15–30%: Yellow zone — build management strategies
   - Over 30%: High disengagement and burnout risk — renegotiation needed

4. Is there a task in your Drained column that you are also doing frequently (multiple times per week)? This is your highest-priority delegation or renegotiation candidate.

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

> *"Week 2 analysis: 34% of my week lands in Drained or Significantly Drained. The most draining items: status report writing (twice weekly, ~3h total), recurring vendor management calls (once a week, SD every time), and detailed spreadsheet reconciliation (ad hoc but frequent). All three are things I do adequately — none are things that use my top strengths. I brought this data to my manager and proposed: shift status reports to a collaborative team doc (reducing my time from 3h to 45min), delegate vendor call note-taking to the coordinator. She agreed. Over the following month my energy balance shifted from 34% drained to 19%."*

## Exercise 03 — 🔍 The Blind Spot Hunt (Informal 360°)

### Goal

Access your Blind Spot Johari quadrant — what others observe in you that you cannot see yourself — through structured, direct requests for honest feedback.

### Why "Informal" — And Why It's Still Rigorous

An organisational 360° tool takes weeks to design and deploy. This exercise achieves a similar level of insight through direct, well-framed conversations or written questions. The key to making it work: the quality of your questions and the explicit permission you give people to be honest.

### Instructions

**Step 1 — Select Your 5 Respondents**
Choose people who:

- Work closely enough with you to have real observations
- Come from different contexts (not just your immediate team)
- Include at least one person who has given you feedback that surprised you in the past

**Step 2 — Write or Ask These Exact Questions**

Option A — In conversation (coffee or 1:1):
> *"I'm doing some deliberate self-development work and I'd genuinely value your input. I want to understand what you observe in how I work, from your perspective. There are no wrong answers and I genuinely want honesty. Can I ask you a few questions?"*
>
> 1. "What do you think I do exceptionally well — that I might undervalue?"
> 2. "Is there one thing you'd genuinely like me to do differently in how we work together?"
> 3. "Is there a pattern you notice in how I show up — something I may not be fully aware of?"

Option B — Written (Google Form or email):
> Send the same three questions with this header: *"I'm taking my development seriously and I need honest input. Your name will not be seen by anyone else and your feedback will only be used for my personal development. Please tell me the truth."*

**Step 3 — Record All Responses Without Editing**

Write down everything that was said — including things that don't land well initially. Don't filter for what's comfortable.

**Step 4 — Pattern Analysis**

| Theme | Mentioned by How Many People? | Their Specific Words | My Emotional Reaction | Is This in My Blind Spot? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

**Step 5 — The Emotional Reaction Signal**

Note your pattern of emotional reaction to each theme:

- **Defensive / "That's not fair":** Likely in the Blind Spot — the defensiveness is a signal that this truth is landing somewhere real
- **"That surprises me — I didn't realise":** Confirmed Blind Spot
- **"I knew that about myself":** This is Hidden (you know it, now it's in Open)
- **"This is familiar — others have said this":** This is in the Open quadrant (probably already known)

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

**Theme identified:** "Two people independently said I sometimes seem impatient in discussions when someone takes a long time to reach their point."

**Emotional reaction:** Mild defensiveness — "I'm not impatient, I'm efficient."

**The signal:** The defensiveness itself confirms this is landing somewhere real. My experience of myself ("efficient") and their experience of me ("impatient") are divergent — that's the Blind Spot.

**The practice elected:** For 30 days, in every meeting where I notice the urge to speed someone along — I pause, breathe, and let them finish without interrupting. At the end of the month, I ask one of the feedback-givers: "Have you noticed any difference?"

## Exercise 04 — 🗺️ The Limits Diagnostic

### Goal

Correctly type each of your current limits — distinguishing skill gaps (develop), energy drains (manage), and values conflicts (examine) — so you can apply the right response to each.

### Instructions (20 minutes per limit)

**Step 1 — List Your Current 5 Most Significant Professional Limits**

Write them honestly. These are areas where you underperform, avoid, or feel stuck:

1. ___________________________
2. ___________________________
3. ___________________________
4. ___________________________
5. ___________________________

**Step 2 — Type Each Limit Using the Diagnostic Questions**

For each limit, answer these three questions:

```
Q1: "If I had focused training, coaching, and practice for 6 months — 
     could I develop genuine competency here?"
→ YES = likely a Skill Gap
→ "I already can do it adequately" = Move to Q2

Q2: "When I do this task and do it reasonably well — 
     am I typically drained afterward? (Not just when it goes badly)"
→ YES = likely Energy Drain
→ NO → Move to Q3

Q3: "Is there a sense of 'wrongness' or identity conflict when I do this — 
     not discomfort but moral or identity resistance?"
→ YES = likely Values Conflict
```

**Step 3 — Build the Limit Response Plan**

| Limit | Type | Response Strategy | Specific Next Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| | Skill Gap | Deliberate practice plan | Identify specific learning goal + when |
| | Energy Drain | Delegation / renegotiation | Identify who or how + timeline |
| | Values Conflict | Naming + deeper conversation | Write the conflict precisely; discuss with manager |
| | | | |

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

**Limit identified:** "Running stakeholder alignment meetings"

**Q1:** "Could I get better with training?" → Yes, probably. But I already run them adequately.
**Q2:** "Am I drained after even good ones?" → Yes, every time. Even when it goes well.
**Q3:** "Is there identity/moral resistance?" → No. It just empties me.

**Type: Energy Drain**

**Response:** Batch all stakeholder alignment meetings to Tuesday afternoons only (energy is higher Tuesday; batching reduces the frequency of recovery cycles). Delegate pre-meeting agenda preparation to the project manager to reduce my prep burden. After 4 weeks: reassess whether the drain reduction is sufficient.

## Exercise 05 — 🔲 The Johari Mapping Session

### Goal

Use all data collected from Exercises 01–04 to build a comprehensive, named Johari Window for your current professional context.

### Prerequisites

At minimum: complete Exercise 01 (strengths) and Exercise 03 (blind spot hunt). This exercise is the synthesis.

### Instructions (60–90 minutes)

**Step 1 — Build the Four Quadrants**

Draw or create a 2×2 grid. Label the four quadrants. Populate each with *specific, named observations* — not vague categories:

**OPEN (Known to me, confirmed by others):**

- My strength data from Exercise 01 that 360° respondents also mentioned
- Skills that are widely acknowledged by peers and that I also recognise
*(e.g., "Structured written communication; pattern identification in complex datasets; mentoring effectiveness")*

**BLIND SPOT (Surfaced by Exercise 03, new to me):**

- What others mentioned that surprised me
- Patterns I hadn't seen in myself
*(e.g., "Appearing impatient in meetings; tendency to resolve others' thinking for them rather than letting them arrive there; visible discomfort with emotional conversations")*

**HIDDEN (I know, but haven't shared or disclosed):**

- Vulnerabilities I don't show professionally
- Strengths I downplay or don't claim
- Fears or concerns I hold internally
*(e.g., "Uncertainty about my direction; latent interest in people development; anxiety about high-visibility public presentations")*

**UNKNOWN (Neither me nor others see clearly):**

- Responses to contexts I've never been in
- Potential in domains I haven't explored
- Deep patterns that therapy, coaching, or major life events might eventually surface

**Step 2 — Prioritise Actions by Quadrant**

| Quadrant | What's There | My Single Most Important Action |
|---|---|---|
| Blind Spot | | Address the 1 pattern with highest professional impact |
| Hidden | | 1 selective disclosure that would build a key relationship |
| Unknown | | 1 new experience or challenge to explore potential |

## Exercise 06 — ⚠️ The Strength Shadow Inventory

### Goal

Identify the specific overuse patterns of your top 3 strengths — building the situational awareness to pull back a strength when it is hurting rather than helping.

### Instructions (30 minutes)

**Step 1 — Name Your Top 3 True Strengths** (from Exercise 01)

**Step 2 — For Each, Complete This Shadow Analysis:**

| Strength | Best Expression | Shadow Expression | When Does the Shadow Appear? | One Early Warning Signal You Can Check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

**Step 3 — Ask the "Too Much" Question**

For each strength, ask one trusted colleague: *"Is there a situation where my [strength] is 'too much'? Or where it gets in the way for you?"*

Record their answer verbatim. This is Blind Spot data refined specifically to strength overuse.

**Step 4 — Design the Return Protocol**

For each shadow expression identified, write one specific "return move" — what you will do when you notice the shadow activating:

| Shadow Expression | Return Move |
|---|---|
| *(e.g.) Analytical rigour → Analysis paralysis* | *(e.g.) Set a 10-minute decision timer; consult one other person; decide)* |
| | |
