## How to Use These Examples

Read each scenario actively — before reading the debrief, try to identify: *What is the person's self-knowledge failure? What type of limit or strength are they misreading?* Then compare your analysis to the debrief.

## Example 01 — The Accidental Manager (Competency ≠ Strength)

**Context:** Senior Data Analyst, promoted to Data Science Manager after being the top technical performer on the team.

**What happened:**
Priya was promoted to manager 9 months ago because she was the best analyst on the team — accurate, fast, analytically creative. Her technical work was universally praised. As manager, her role is now 70% people-coordination: 1-on-1s, hiring, stakeholder communication, translating business requirements, reviewing others' work, and managing performance.

She is technically still capable. Her team respects her expertise. But she has started arriving to work later, leaving earlier, and her manager has noticed she is "less present" in leadership meetings than she was before promotion.

**Inner experience:**
> *"The analysis work we do is still great — I keep a hand in when I can. But I spend half my week in conversations that feel circular. I feel like I'm following up on things that should be obvious, having the same conversations repeatedly. At the end of a week of back-to-back 1:1s and stakeholder meetings, I feel hollowed out. I used to feel excited on Sunday evening. Now I feel flat."*

**The Self-Knowledge Failure:**

| Element | What Is Actually Happening |
|---|---|
| **Misclassified strength** | Deep analytical work was both a competency AND a true strength (Performance + Energy + Authenticity all present) |
| **New role requirement** | People-coordination, stakeholder translation, repetitive communication — these are Energy Drains for Priya |
| **Limit type confounded** | Her manager is treating her as having a "skill gap" in leadership → sending her to leadership training. She may actually have an energy drain in people-coordination work. |
| **The real question** | Does the management role require permanently high people-coordination load? Or can the role be structured to preserve analysis access? |

**What a coach would say:**
> *"This is a classic competency-to-strength confusion that happens in promotions. You were excellent at analysis AND it was your energy source. Your new role has removed the energy source and replaced it with a different activity — which you can do adequately but which doesn't sustain you."*
>
> *"Before we call this a leadership skill gap — let's type this correctly. When you have a great 1:1 that results in genuine development in your team member, how do you feel? If the answer is 'fairly good but mostly just relieved it went well' — that's a signal. If 'genuinely energised by their growth' — then people leadership might be a strength you haven't fully developed yet. Which is it?"*

**Regulated outcome:**
Priya identifies that: deep analysis is a true strength (Energy: Energised); people-coordination is a learned competency (Energy: Drained); strategic communication is developing (in the middle). She and her manager redesign her week: she keeps a 20% technical contribution to the team's hardest problems (preserving her energy source), offloads status coordination to a project manager, and focuses her people time on the 2–3 direct reports showing the most growth potential (higher energy from seeing development). Three months later, she reports: "I feel like myself again."

## Example 02 — The Man With No Blind Spots (Who Had the Biggest One)

**Context:** Engineering Director at a 300-person tech company; 15 years' experience; widely regarded as technically brilliant.

**What happened:**
Suresh regularly scores in the top percentile on performance reviews. He is highly confident in his self-knowledge — "I know what I'm good at and what I need help with." He has built a reputation as someone who is direct, fast, and decisive. At the same time, over the past year, two strong senior engineers have left the team; one gave exit interview feedback that was not shared with Suresh.

**The Hidden Pattern (what others see):**
In technical design discussions, when someone proposes something Suresh disagrees with, he says "No, that won't work" — briefly, flatly, without exploring the other person's thinking. People read this as "my input is not welcome here." They stop bringing ideas. His best engineers work more independently, and bring fewer of their most ambitious ideas to the team.

**His Self-Assessment:**
"I give direct feedback because ambiguity slows things down. People on my team know I respect their work. They know I'll push back when I disagree — that's healthy debate."

**The Johari Window Analysis:**

| Quadrant | What's There |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Technical excellence; decisiveness; high standards; demanding but fair to those who perform |
| **Blind Spot** | Impact of his "No, that won't work" on psychological safety; that senior engineers are self-censoring; that his directness is experienced as dismissiveness, not healthy debate |
| **Hidden** | His own uncertainty in ambiguous strategic decisions (he doesn't show this) |
| **Unknown** | What he would be like as a leader of leaders who needed coaching and developing rather than technical guiding |

**What the Exit Interview Revealed (shared to him by HR after the second departure):**
> *"The technical direction was excellent. I left because I stopped feeling like my thinking was welcome in the room. My ideas were decided against in seconds without exploration. I can work with high standards. I can't work in an environment where I feel like a pair of hands rather than a thinking engineer."*

**Regulated response (after the data reaches Suresh):**
Suresh runs a 360°. Three themes emerge from blind spot: speed of dismissal; insufficient curiosity about engineers' reasoning before deciding; visible impatience with exploratory thinking. He designs a specific practice: in every technical discussion, before stating his position, he asks: "Walk me through your reasoning." He discovers three things he hadn't known by the end of the first month.

## Example 03 — The Wrong Solution for the Wrong Type of Limit

**Context:** Product Manager, struggling with data analysis work, sent to a SQL training course.

**What happened:**
Rahul is a strong product manager — excellent at customer empathy, stakeholder alignment, and translating user needs into product requirements. His manager identified "data analysis" as a development area: Rahul struggles with the data work required to build business cases and measure feature success. He was sent to a SQL course.

Midway through the course, Rahul is finding it deeply unengaging. He completes tasks but retains little. His manager is frustrated that the investment isn't producing visible change.

**The Limit Typing Error:**

| Diagnostic Question | Answer | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| "Could Rahul learn this with enough practice?" | Probably yes, at basic proficiency | Suggests Skill Gap |
| "Is he drained by data analysis even when he does it adequately?" | Yes — reliably, regardless of outcome | Suggests Energy Drain |
| "Is there values resistance?" | No — he agrees it's important | No values conflict |

**The Real Type: Energy Drain, not Skill Gap**

The SQL training is the wrong solution for an Energy Drain. Even if Rahul completes the course and develops SQL skills, the work will still deplete him — it just depletes a more capable version of him. The right response to an Energy Drain is minimisation, delegation, or structural redesign — not training to make you more skilled at the draining thing.

**What a coach would say:**
> *"The question isn't whether Rahul can learn SQL. It's whether his role should require him to own data analysis deeply, given that it drains his energy. Could the business intelligence analyst pull this work? Could you redesign Rahul's role so he provides the questions and context while someone else does the extraction and modelling? Would that free him for the stakeholder and customer work where he genuinely excels?"*

**Regulated outcome:**
Manager and Rahul discuss the limit type. Decision: Rahul will develop basic data literacy (enough to read and interpret analysis) but partner with the BI team for actual data extraction and modelling. The training is changed from "SQL bootcamp" to "Data literacy for PMs" — a 4-hour course on interpreting analyses, not building them. Rahul's time is freed for customer research and alignment work where his true strengths operate.

## Example 04 — The Strength That Became a Weapon

**Context:** Senior Engineering Manager, analytical rigour as primary strength; managing a 12-person team.

**What happened:**
Ananya's signature strength is analytical rigour — she catches logical gaps others miss, builds airtight cases for decisions, and has never proposed a strategy that wasn't thoroughly evidenced. This strength made her a phenomenal individual contributor and a highly credible senior engineer.

As engineering manager, she applies the same analytical rigour to her team's proposals. In team meetings, she systematically deconstructs every proposal for flaws before endorsing it. The analysis is usually correct. Within 6 months, the team has stopped bringing early-stage ideas to group discussion. They only share ideas that are already heavily researched and defensible — which means nothing speculative or creative enters the pipeline.

**The Strength Shadow:**

| Strength | Best Expression | Shadow Expression | What Caused the Crossing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analytical rigour | Catches genuine errors in mature proposals; builds decision-making credibility | Premature evaluation of early-stage thinking; kills creative speculation before it can develop | Applied the right tool to the wrong stage of an idea |

**Inner experience (Ananya's):**
> *"I'm maintaining standards. We don't have time to explore half-baked ideas in our roadmap process. If an idea can't survive initial scrutiny, it's better to know that early."*

**Team experience:**
> "She shoots ideas down before they have a chance to breathe. I used to bring my best thinking to team meetings. Now I bring only what I know she can't find a flaw in — which means I'm never bringing my most creative work."

**The Johari Window Data Point:**
This is a Blind Spot — Ananya's experience of the behaviour ("maintaining standards") is fundamentally different from the team's experience ("ideas are not welcome here").

**The Return Protocol she designed:**
In all early-stage idea discussions, she uses a rule: "The first 5 minutes of any new idea discussion are curiosity-only — no evaluation. My job in that window is to understand, not assess." She explicitly tells her team about this change. Within 2 months: two engineers who had gone quiet in meetings are contributing speculative design thinking again.

## Example 05 — Unknown Strength Discovered Through New Challenge

**Context:** Backend engineer, no interest in leadership, asked to run a technical onboarding programme.

**What happened:**
Kiran was the team's most technically experienced engineer and had explicitly told his manager "I don't want any people management responsibilities — I'm here for the engineering." He agreed to run the technical onboarding programme only reluctantly, as a one-time favour.

During the onboarding cohort, he found himself spending significant time after sessions explaining concepts in ways that actually reached the particular junior engineer rather than the average one — adapting on the fly, finding analogies that worked. He noticed he was energised by the sessions in a way he wasn't by his normal engineering work.

**The Johari Unknown → Open Shift:**

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| "Teaching/development" — Unknown quadrant (he hadn't tried it, neither had anyone else seen it) | "Technical mentoring and explanation" — moved to Open (he experiences it as energising; junior engineers have explicitly said he explains things in ways no one else does) |

**What this reveals:**
The Unknown quadrant is not just about undiscovered problems — it contains undiscovered strengths that only emerge through novel experiences that force new behaviours. Kiran's value to the organisation expanded significantly when a constraint (shortage of onboarding capacity) pushed him into territory he wouldn't have chosen.

**The learning:**
Deliberate self-expansion — doing things outside your current strength map — is one of the only ways to access the Unknown quadrant. The Johari Window shrinks (or at least, stops expanding) when we only operate in our existing competency zones.

## Example 06 — Limits as Communication: The Values Conflict Named

**Context:** Mid-level consultant asked to lead a client deliverable that involves presenting findings the team believes are incomplete.

**What happened:**
Deepa's consulting team has been under timeline pressure. The client is demanding the deliverable before the team has completed adequate validation. Deepa's manager has directed the team to present findings as "exploratory but directional" and move forward. Deepa is asked to lead the client presentation.

She keeps asking for extensions, delaying preparation, saying "I'm not comfortable with where the analysis is." Her manager reads this as scope anxiety — and sends her for time management coaching.

**The Real Type: Values Conflict**

| Diagnostic | Deepa's Answer |
|---|---|
| "Could you get better at this with training?" | "Yes — but that's not the issue" |
| "Are you depleted by presentation work?" | "No — I love presenting when I believe in what I'm presenting" |
| "Is there moral/identity resistance?" | "Yes — I don't feel I can honestly present this as directional when I believe clients may act on it incorrectly" |

**Type: Values Conflict — specifically around professional integrity and intellectual honesty**

**What the right conversation looks like:**
> *Deepa to her manager:* "I want to be honest with you. This isn't anxiety about presenting or about managing my time. I have a genuine integrity concern about presenting findings I believe are materially incomplete in a way the client might treat as validated. I understand the timeline pressure. Can we find a framing that is both honest about the validation status and still useful for the client's next steps? If the answer is 'the framing won't change' — I need to understand that clearly so I can decide what I want to do."*

**What her manager learned:**
The resistance was not a performance problem — it was a signal. Deepa's values conflict surfaced a legitimate quality concern. The conversation led to a different framing of the deliverable. The feedback from the client: they appreciated the explicit acknowledgment of what was validated and what was preliminary — and trusted the team more for it.
