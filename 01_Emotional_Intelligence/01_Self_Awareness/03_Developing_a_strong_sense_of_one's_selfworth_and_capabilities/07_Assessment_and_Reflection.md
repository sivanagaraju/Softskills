## 🔍 Part 2: Reflection Prompts

Take 10–15 minutes to write your answers in a journal or document. These are designed to surface subconscious beliefs.

### On Self-Worth

1. **When do you feel most worthy?** What conditions are present? *(What does this reveal about where your worth is conditional?)*

2. **Think of someone whose confidence you admire.** What do you think they believe about themselves that you don't yet believe about yourself?

3. **What is one area of your life where you consistently underestimate yourself?** How do you know this? *(List the evidence that contradicts your self-judgment.)*

---

### On Capabilities

1. **Name three capabilities you have developed significantly in the last 3 years** that you didn't have before. *(This is direct evidence that your abilities change with effort.)*

2. **What is a skill you are currently avoiding developing** because some part of you believes you "just aren't that type of person"? *(What would a Growth Mindset response look like?)*

3. **If a trusted mentor could see all your work over the last 90 days**, what capabilities would they say you are demonstrating? *(Write from their perspective.)*

---

### On Imposter Syndrome

1. **Recall a recent success.** What are the honest, honest reasons it went well? *(List at least 3 things YOU did or brought to it — not luck.)*

2. **In what situations do you feel most like an imposter?** What triggers it — new environments, senior people, high visibility?

3. **What would you need to believe about yourself** to fully own the role or title you currently hold?
