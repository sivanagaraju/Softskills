## Exercise 01 — 🔍 The Worth Audit

### Goal

Identify precisely where you currently anchor your sense of worth — so you can see the structure of its conditionality, and therefore know exactly what you're working to untangle.

### Why Do This First

You cannot create an unconditional Worth Anchor (Exercise 02) without first understanding what conditional hooks your self-worth is currently tied to. Most people have no idea how conditional their worth is until they map it explicitly.

### Instructions (20 minutes)

**Part A — The Performance Hook Inventory**

Complete each sentence honestly. Write the first response that comes to mind — do not edit for what sounds right:

1. "I feel most valuable at work when ___________________________"
2. "I feel least valuable at work when ___________________________"
3. "If I were made redundant / passed over for promotion, the story I would tell myself about what that means about me is: ___________________________"
4. "When I make a significant mistake in front of colleagues, I feel ___________________________"
5. "People whose validation makes me feel more substantial or valuable include: ___________________________"
6. "If I stopped receiving external praise entirely, my internal experience of my own value would: ___________________________"

**Part B — The Conditionality Map**

For each honest answer above, identify the underlying condition it reveals. Use this table:

| Your Honest Answer | The Condition it Reveals | Core Need Being Driven |
|---|---|---|
| *(e.g.) "I feel most valuable when my manager praises my work"* | *(My worth requires external validation from authority)* | *(Approval / recognition)* |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Part C — The Stability Test**

Rate each condition on two scales:

| Condition | How often is this condition met? (1–10) | How much control do I have over whether it's met? (1–10) |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

**Interpretation:** Conditions that are met infrequently (low score) and that you can't control (low score) are the *most dangerous* anchoring points for your worth — they guarantee frequent periods of feeling worthless despite this being entirely circumstantial.

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

> *"My honest Part A answers revealed that I feel least valuable when I'm in a room where everyone seems more senior or knowledgeable. The condition: worth requires demonstrated superiority in the room. My control over that: near zero — it depends entirely on who's in the room. This tells me my worth is tied to comparative performance — and that's an extremely fragile foundation in any professional setting."*

## Exercise 02 — ✍️ Writing Your Self-Worth Anchor Statement

### Goal

Create a durable, personally resonant, unconditional Worth Anchor — a written statement to return to when conditional worth spirals activate.

### Prerequisites

Complete Exercise 01 first. Your conditionality map will inform what non-conditional worth sources need to explicitly replace.

### Instructions (30 minutes)

**Step 1 — Identify Your Unconditional Worth Sources (10 minutes)**

Using the prompts below, identify 5–7 qualities, values, or ways of being that are TRUE about you regardless of any particular outcome:

- What do people who know you well and love you say about your character?
- What do you stand for, regardless of whether it makes you successful?
- How do you show up for people who need you — not what do you achieve for them?
- What quality of yours has persisted through failure, rejection, and difficulty?
- What would you want people to say about who you *were* — not what you accomplished?

> Example unconditional sources: curiosity, honesty under pressure, genuine care for others' growth, persistence, intellectual rigour, warmth, the way I listen, the way I fight for what I believe is right.

**Step 2 — Identify the Condition You're Replacing (5 minutes)**

From your Exercise 01 audit, identify the 1–2 most dangerous conditional hooks:
> "I have been tying my worth to: [condition]. This needs to be explicitly replaced."

**Step 3 — Write Your Anchor Statement (15 minutes)**

Use this full template:

```
MY SELF-WORTH ANCHOR STATEMENT
Written: [Date]

My worth as a person is NOT determined by:
→ [Condition 1 from your audit]
→ [Condition 2 from your audit]

My worth is rooted in the fact that I am a person who:
→ [Unconditional quality 1 + a specific example of it in action]
→ [Unconditional quality 2 + a specific example of it in action]  
→ [Unconditional quality 3 + a specific example of it in action]

These qualities are true whether I [succeed or fail at the conditional thing].
The outcome of [the conditional thing] is information about circumstances.
It does not define my value as a person.

When I feel my worth falling, the first question I ask is:
"Is this a facts-based assessment, or is it the conditional worth story running again?"
```

**Step 4 — Calibration Check**
Read your completed statement aloud. Does it:

- ✅ Refer to qualities, values, or character — not achievements?
- ✅ Feel *true* even in your worst moments?
- ✅ Not require any external validation to be accurate?
- ✅ Address the specific conditions that most destabilise you?

If you answered no to any — revise until all four are yes.

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

> *"My worth is NOT determined by whether I reach Staff Engineer by 30, or whether my manager specifically recognises my contribution in the next review.*
> *My worth is rooted in: my intellectual honesty (I say what I actually think, even when it's uncomfortable — I did this last week when I told the product team their estimate was unrealistic); my commitment to building others up (I spent 3 hours helping Priya with her architecture before my own deadline); my persistence through difficulty (I stayed with the migration problem for 3 days when others had moved on).*
> *Whether I get the promotion or the recognition: those are signals about timing and organisational context. They do not alter what kind of person I am."*

## Exercise 03 — 🔬 The Imposter Evidence Review

### Goal

Test your imposter patterns rigorously against documented evidence — shifting from feeling-based self-assessment to fact-based attribution.

### Instructions (25 minutes)

**Step 1 — Capture your current imposter thoughts (5 min)**

Write down every imposter thought you are currently experiencing about your professional situation. Don't filter — write all of them:

- "I'm not as good as they think I am"
- "My success on [X] was mostly luck"
- "I'll be found out eventually"
- "Others here are more capable than I am"

**Step 2 — The Evidence Test (15 min)**

For each imposter thought, complete this analysis:

| Imposter Thought | Evidence FOR this thought (specific facts) | Evidence AGAINST this thought (specific facts) | The More Accurate Attribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(e.g.) "My success on the project was luck"* | *(The timeline was convenient / Stakeholders were easy to please)* | *(I led 12 team calls / Identified and resolved 3 critical blockers / Manager said it was my best work)* | *("I led a complex project effectively. The conditions were favourable AND I executed well. Both can be true.")* |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Step 3 — The Attribution Rewrite (5 min)**

For each imposter thought, write the most *accurate* attribution — one that includes internal factors (your effort, skill, preparation) alongside any genuine external factors:

> "The accurate statement is not 'I succeeded because of luck' OR 'I succeeded purely because of my brilliance.' It is: 'I succeeded because [X] — my specific contribution — combined with [Y] — contextual factors. My contribution was real and identifiable.'"

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

**Imposter thought:** "I got the promotion because the team needed someone and I was there."

| Evidence For | Evidence Against | Accurate Attribution |
|---|---|---|
| There was a gap when Arun left | My manager had three months to pick anyone; she specifically advocated for me | The gap created an opportunity. I was chosen because I had demonstrated X, Y, and Z in the preceding year. The gap and my readiness intersected. |

## Exercise 04 — 🪜 Design Your Mastery Ladder

### Goal

Build a deliberate, sequenced mastery ladder for the ONE capability you most want to develop in the next 90 days.

### Instructions (40 minutes)

**Step 1 — Select the Capability (5 min)**
From your Capability Map (or from what you know is your most important development edge), select ONE specific capability. Be specific:

> ❌ "Be more confident" — too vague
> ✅ "Lead difficult conversations with composure and directness" — specific enough to design rungs for

**Step 2 — Define Success at Rung 5 (The Top) (5 min)**
Describe in precise, observable, behavioural terms what it looks like when you have fully developed this capability in a high-stakes context:
> "In [high-stakes situation], I would [specific observable behaviour], and the outcome would be [measurable result]."

**Step 3 — Design the 5 Rungs (20 min)**

Working backward from Rung 5, design each progressive rung:

| Rung | Task Description | Success Criteria (observable) | Time Frame |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 (Target) | Full capability in high-stakes context | | 90 days |
| 4 | Moderate-stakes version | | 60–75 days |
| 3 | Low-stakes version with real consequences | | 30–45 days |
| 2 | Simplified version with low consequences | | 14–21 days |
| 1 | Smallest possible enactment of the behaviour | | This week |

**Step 4 — Identify What Rung 1 Looks Like Specifically (10 min)**

Write the exact scenario for your first rung attempt:
> "Within the next 7 days, I will [specific action] in [specific context] and I will consider rung 1 complete when [specific observable outcome]."

**Step 5 — Log and Continue**
After each rung: add a Wins Archive entry, reflect on what worked or needs adjustment, design the next attempt at the same or next rung.

## Exercise 05 — 🗺️ The Capability Map (With External Validation)

### Goal

Create an accurate, externally calibrated picture of your current capability landscape — replacing inaccurate self-perception with fact-based clarity.

### Instructions (Week 1 — Self-Assessment, Week 2 — External Validation)

**Week 1, Part A — Inventory (30 min)**

List 12–15 capabilities relevant to your current professional role and goals. Include technical skills, soft skills, and emerging capabilities:

| Capability | Self-Rating (1–10) | Category |
|---|---|---|
| | | Core Strength / Developing / Early / Weak |
| | | |

**Week 1, Part B — The Johari Window Check**

For each capability in your "Core Strength" category, ask: "Is this acknowledged by others, or only by me?" For each "Weak" category: "Is this actually weak, or is this an imposter-pattern underestimation?"

**Week 2 — External Validation (Ask 3 Trusted People)**

Send or say exactly this:
> "I'm doing a deliberate self-development exercise and I'd genuinely value your input. Three questions:
>
> 1. What do you consistently observe me doing effectively that I might not notice or undervalue?
> 2. If you could give me one honest developmental feedback, what would it be?
> 3. Is there a capability you think I underestimate in myself?"

**Synthesis — Where Map and Reality Diverge**

| Capability | Self-Rating | Their View | Divergence (±) | What to Do With It |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

Significant divergences (3+ points) in either direction are your most valuable development data.

## Exercise 06 — 💚 The Self-Compassion Audit

### Goal

Identify your dominant self-criticism patterns, write a self-compassionate alternative, and practise applying it to a real recent failure.

### Part A — Your Self-Criticism Inventory

Complete these sentences honestly:

1. "When I make a mistake in front of others, I typically say to myself: ___________________________"
2. "When I fail at something I cared about, my internal voice sounds like: ___________________________"
3. "The last time I was really harsh with myself was: ___________________________ and I said: ___________________________"
4. "If a close friend described the same situation to me, I would say to them: ___________________________"

**The Gap Analysis:**
Write the difference between what you say to yourself vs. what you say to a friend:
> The gap is: ___________________________
> The reason for the gap is probably: ___________________________

### Part B — The Self-Compassion 3-Step Applied to a Real Situation

Choose one real recent failure or mistake you have been self-critical about. Apply all three Neff components:

**1. Mindfulness — What is actually true about this situation?**
> Describe it with precision (not dramatisation, not minimisation): "What happened was ___________________________"

**2. Common Humanity — How universal is this?**
> "Every professional who attempts to grow has experienced ___________________________"
> "I am not uniquely flawed for ___________________________"

**3. Self-Kindness — What would I tell my closest friend?**
> Write the full message as if writing to a friend who had experienced this exact failure: ___________________________

Now read that message back to yourself, substituting your own name. Notice how differently it lands.

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

**Situation:** Failed to deliver a project milestone on time. Team impacted.

**Self-criticism pattern:** "I let everyone down. I should have seen this coming. I'm not organised enough for this level."

**Step 3 — Self-compassion letter to a friend:**
> "What happened was genuinely difficult. You took on a more complex project than you'd handled before, with a team that depended on your coordination. You made certain calls that didn't work out. That is what happens when you take on stretch assignments — you encounter your current limits. Those limits are exactly the edges that growth happens at. You handled the aftermath honestly — you communicated early when it became clear, you didn't hide it, you helped the team recalibrate. That matters. One delayed milestone doesn't define your capability as a leader. What you do next is what defines it."
