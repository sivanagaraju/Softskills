## Exercise 01 — 🧘 Body Signal Calibration

### Goal

Build your personal library of body signals that precede or accompany emotional trigger reactions — your earliest accessible warning system.

### Why Do This First

Most trigger-awareness work starts too cognitively. People try to *think* their way into recognising triggers. But the body always signals before conscious thought. This exercise trains your body-awareness so that all subsequent techniques become far more effective.

### Part A — Recall and Map (15 minutes)

**Step 1:** Think of 2–3 recent situations where you had a strong emotional reaction. Choose one that was moderately strong (not your most traumatic, not trivially minor — aim for 5–7/10 intensity).

**Step 2:** Close your eyes. Breathe slowly. Vividly recall the exact moment the emotion peaked. Mentally be back in that moment.

**Step 3:** Without trying to change anything, scan your body from head to feet. Where do you feel *something*? Tension, heat, hollowness, tightness, pressure, tingling, urge to move?

**Step 4:** Open your eyes. Complete this table for each memory you recalled:

| Memory (brief description) | Where in body | Physical sensation | Emotion it was linked to |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(e.g.) Being interrupted in meeting* | *(Chest)* | *(Tight, compressed, shallow breath)* | *(Shame + rage)* |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Step 5:** Look for patterns. Do the same body region appear across different memories? Do the same emotions link to the same body areas for you?

### Part B — The Real-Time Check-In (7 days)

Set 3 random phone alarms daily for the next week. When each alarm fires, wherever you are:

1. Stop for 30 seconds
2. Scan your body from head to feet
3. Rate your current tension level 0–10
4. Name one emotion that matches what you feel physically
5. Note: Has anything happened in the last hour that might have primed this?

**What you are building:** The habit of consulting your body as a real-time emotional barometer — before the emotion becomes conscious and overwhelming.

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

Someone doing this exercise well writes:
> *"I noticed that my jaw tension and shallow breathing are my earliest signals for anger/frustration — appearing even before I consciously feel upset. My hollow stomach is specifically linked to fear of disappointment or abandonment — it appeared when I saw my manager had replied to my email with just 'ok.' I now know that when those two signals appear together, a trigger is very likely active."*

## Exercise 02 — 📋 Trigger Inventory (Broad Mapping)

### Goal

Create a comprehensive first map of your known emotional triggers across all major life domains, establishing a broad view of your trigger landscape before going deep on any single trigger.

### Instructions

Work through each domain below. For each domain, recall 1–2 situations in the last 6 months that activated a notable emotional reaction. Complete the table honestly. If nothing comes to mind for a domain, write "none identified yet" — not every domain will be active for everyone.

**Domain 1 — Workplace / Professional**
Interactions with managers, peers, clients, performance evaluations, workload, recognition (or its absence), autonomy, meetings.

| Situation | Specific Trigger | Emotion | Intensity (1–10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Domain 2 — Communication Style**
How people speak to you, tone of voice, being interrupted, condescension, passive aggression, silence after a message sent.

| Situation | Specific Trigger | Emotion | Intensity (1–10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Domain 3 — Recognition and Fairness**
Being overlooked for credit, someone else taking your contribution, perceived unfairness in decisions, salary, promotions.

| Situation | Specific Trigger | Emotion | Intensity (1–10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Domain 4 — Control and Autonomy**
Being micromanaged, having decisions made without input, rules you disagree with, feeling powerless in systems.

| Situation | Specific Trigger | Emotion | Intensity (1–10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Domain 5 — Belonging and Inclusion**
Being left out of conversations, groups, or decisions; feeling like an outsider; social exclusion.

| Situation | Specific Trigger | Emotion | Intensity (1–10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Domain 6 — Personal Relationships**
Family dynamics, romantic relationships, close friendships. Moments of conflict, distance, betrayal, or unmet expectations.

| Situation | Specific Trigger | Emotion | Intensity (1–10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Synthesis Questions

After completing all domains:

1. **Which domain has the most entries?** This is your most active trigger landscape.
2. **Which single entry has the highest intensity rating?** This is your priority trigger for Exercise 05.
3. **What is the ONE emotion that appears most frequently across all domains?**
4. **What does the recurring emotion suggest about the core need that isn't being met?**

## Exercise 03 — 📊 Proportionality Audit Practice

### Goal

Train the specific skill of detecting the gap between situational severity and emotional reaction intensity — your primary diagnostic tool for recognising when a trigger has fired.

### The 5-Event Audit

Recall 5 recent emotional reactions of varying intensity. For each, complete the audit:

```
Event: _______________________________________________

Objective situation severity (1–10):
How bad was this, assessed by someone with no stake in the outcome?  ___

My emotional reaction intensity (1–10):
How intense did my emotional experience actually feel?               ___

The Gap (reaction – severity):                                       ___

Gap Analysis:
0–2 gap  → Proportionate. What does the situation actually need?
3–5 gap  → Moderate trigger. What old story activated?
6+ gap   → Strong trigger. What wound is this touching?

For each gap of 3+, answer:
What story ran in my head?      ________________________________
What core need felt threatened? ________________________________
What does this pattern remind me of from before now?
                                ________________________________
```

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like

For a completed entry:
> *"Event: My proposal was rejected in the meeting without discussion. Severity: 4/10 (it was one idea, easily revised, no major consequence). My reaction intensity: 9/10. Gap: 5. The story that ran: 'They don't take me seriously. My work doesn't matter here.' Core need threatened: Respect and being seen as competent. This pattern reminds me of: Submitting essays to my father for review and having them dismissed without reading them properly. This was not about the proposal — this was about that."*

## Exercise 04 — 📓 The 14-Day Trigger Log

### Goal

Generate enough data across a consistent period to identify your 3 primary trigger patterns — the themes that cut across multiple isolated events.

### Instructions

Keep the following log accessible (phone notes, pocket notebook, or printed sheet) for 14 consecutive days. Every time you notice a noticeable emotional reaction (aiming for 3+ entries per day, including small reactions), make a brief entry:

```
Date/Time: ___________
Trigger: ___________
Emotion: ___________  Intensity: ___/10
Body signal: ___________
Category: [ ] People  [ ] Situation  [ ] Cognitive  [ ] Sensory  [ ] Physiological
```

### Day 14 — Pattern Analysis Session (30 minutes)

1. **Count entries by category** — which category dominates?
2. **List your top 5 highest-intensity triggers** — what do they have in common?
3. **List your top 5 most frequent triggers** — what theme connects them?
4. **Do high-frequency and high-intensity triggers overlap?** Where they do, that is your priority wound.
5. **Complete this statement:**
   > "My dominant trigger pattern is [*************]. It consistently activates the emotion of [*************]. The story underneath it seems to be that [*************]. This points to a core need for [*************]."

## Exercise 05 — 🔍 The Full Trigger Interview

### Goal

Conduct a structured, deep investigation of *one* significant trigger event — tracing it from the present reaction all the way back to its origin story.

### Preparation

- Choose the highest-intensity event from your Trigger Inventory or 14-Day Log
- Set aside 45–60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Have paper or an open document ready
- Have some water and a comfortable space — this can be emotionally stirring

### The Interview in Full

**PART 1 — ESTABLISH THE FACTS**

> *Q1: Describe the event as a neutral CCTV camera would record it. Facts only — no interpretation.*
> ___

> *Q2: What was the EXACT moment your emotion spiked? Not the general event — the specific second.*
> Was it a specific word? A shift in tone? A silence? A facial expression? A gesture?
> ___

**PART 2 — INTERNAL EXPERIENCE**

> *Q3: What did you feel in your body, and where?*
> ___

> *Q4: Name the emotion(s) precisely. Not "bad" or "upset." What was the specific feeling?*
> Aim for: shame / rage / dread / grief / helplessness / humiliation / betrayal / etc.
> ___

> *Q5: If your internal monologue had subtitles playing during this event, what would they say?*
> Write the actual internal sentences: "They think I'm..." / "This always happens to me..." / "I'll never be..."
> ___

**PART 3 — TRACE TO SOURCE**

> *Q6: On a scale of 1–10, how severe was the objective situation? How intense was your reaction?*
> Severity: ___/ Reaction:___ / Gap: ___

> *Q7 (The Age Question): When that emotion flooded through you, how old did it make you feel? Not intellectually — instinctively.*
> ___

> *Q8 (The Echo Question): When is the EARLIEST you can remember feeling this exact emotion at this intensity?*
> How old were you? Where were you? Who was there? What happened?
> ___

> *Q9 (The Belief Question): What did young-you conclude from that experience? Complete: "I learned that I am..." or "I learned that people..."*
> ___

**PART 4 — REAPPRAISAL**

> *Q10: Is that belief still true today, for the adult you are right now?*
> Evidence that contradicts it (list at least 3 specific facts):
>
> 1. ___
> 2. ___
> 3. ___

> *Q11: How would the most resourced, regulated version of you respond to the trigger event — knowing what you now know?*
> ___

### 🌟 What a Strong Response Looks Like (abbreviated)

> *Q4: "I felt shame — a hot, sinking shame that I wasn't competent enough. Not just frustration."*
>
> *Q5: "My subtitles were: 'You see — you don't belong at this level. They know you're faking it. You're going to be found out.'"*
>
> *Q8: "I was 11. I had worked on a school project and showed it to my uncle. He looked at it for 30 seconds and said 'this isn't very good, is it?' in front of everyone at dinner."*
>
> *Q9: "I learned that my work is probably not good enough — and that others will see that before I do."*
>
> *Q10: "Evidence against: I was promoted last year. My manager specifically cited my technical depth in my review. Three colleagues asked for my input last week on their approach."*

## Exercise 06 — ✍️ Core Wound Letter (Therapeutic Writing)

### Goal

Write a compassionate, truthful letter from your current adult self to the younger version of you who first experienced the wound that drives your primary trigger pattern.

### Why This Works

The nervous system responds to language and narrative, not just intellectual argument. When you write to your younger self with genuine compassion and address the wound directly — acknowledging the pain, validating the adaptive response, and offering an updated truth — you are not just reflecting. You are creating a cognitive-emotional update that the nervous system can incorporate over time.

This is not about blame. It is not about rehearsing grievances. It is a letter of acknowledgment and liberation.

### The Structure

**Address:** "Dear [Your name] at [age from Q8 of Trigger Interview],"

**Section 1 — Acknowledge what happened.**
Describe what happened to young-you with accuracy and compassion. Don't minimise it. Don't deflect. Name it.
> "I know what happened. You were [age], and [describe the experience]. And it hurt. It made sense that it hurt."

**Section 2 — Validate the belief you formed.**
The belief young-you formed was a *rational adaptation* at the time. Acknowledge that.
> "The belief you formed — that [the core wound belief] — made complete sense given what you experienced. It was an incredibly smart way to protect yourself at the time."

**Section 3 — Tell them what you know now.**
What does the adult you know that contradicts or contextualises the old belief?
> "But here is what I know now, that you couldn't have known then..."

**Section 4 — The updated truth.**
Not a forced positive, but a more accurate, nuanced truth than the wound-belief.
> "The truth is that [more accurate belief]..."

**Section 5 — What you wish someone had said to you then.**
Close the letter with the words young-you needed and never received.

### After Writing

- Read the letter out loud if you can
- Notice what you feel in your body as you read it
- Keep it. Return to it when the same trigger fires in future.
