# 📚 Tools & Resources — Identifying Personal Triggers

---

## How to Use This Resource Guide

Don't read this as a list to collect. Read it as a **curation of the exact resources most directly relevant to this concept**, with enough context for you to know *which* one to pick up *next* based on your current position in the learning journey.

**Recommended path:** Start with the 2-minute video and the Daylio app while doing the 14-day log. Read *Emotional Agility* in parallel. Once you have done the Full Trigger Interview, read *The Body Keeps the Score* if your traces go deep.

## 📖 Books — Deep Reads, Ranked by Entry Point

---

### 1. *Emotional Agility* — Susan David ⭐ Start Here

**Who it's for:** Anyone beginning trigger awareness work who wants accessible, research-backed content without therapy-level intensity.

**What it actually covers:**
Harvard psychologist Susan David provides a framework for what she calls "emotional agility" — the capacity to experience difficult emotions, including trigger reactions, without being *controlled* by them or *suppressing* them. Her opening distinction is powerful: most people are either "bottling" (pushing emotions down) or "brooding" (getting consumed by them). Neither works. Agility is the third option.

The book is particularly good on identifying what she calls your "emotional hooks" — specific situations, words, or dynamics that reliably produce disproportionate reactions. Her writing on how our emotions are framed as stories (not facts) is directly applicable to the Trigger Interview technique.

**The quote you need:**
> *"Emotions are data, not directives. The fact that you feel something intensely does not mean you have to act on it."*

**Key concept to extract:** The "move on" practice — a specific 4-step sequence for engaging with a triggered emotion without being consumed by it or suppressing it.

**What this book won't do:** It won't take you into childhood wound origin work or neuroscience depth. It stays at the awareness and short-term regulation level.

### 2. *The Body Keeps the Score* — Bessel van der Kolk ⭐ After your first Trigger Interview

**Who it's for:** Anyone whose trigger tracing reveals deep, body-held patterns — particularly those linked to early trauma, chronic stress, or experiences that "live in the body" inexplicably.

**What it actually covers:**
Van der Kolk's landmark work established that traumatic experiences — and the triggers they create — are not stored primarily in the narrative memory (the hippocampus) but in the body's sensorimotor memory (the amygdala and body tissues). This is why talk therapy alone often does not resolve deep triggers: you can tell the story a hundred times but the body still reacts.

He provides both the neuroscience (detailed and accessible) and the therapeutic pathways: EMDR, somatic experiencing, yoga, theatre, and play. His clinical case studies are some of the clearest illustrations of how specific triggers form from specific traumatic events.

**The key insight that changes practice:**
Your body has its own memory, independent of your narrative memory. When you wonder "why does this keep happening?" even after years of intellectual understanding — this book explains the mechanism.

**What this book will demand:** Emotional readiness. It deals with real trauma. If reading it consistently dysregulates you, work with a trauma-informed therapist in parallel.

*Somatic healing works with the limbic brain and body memory rather than relying solely on cortical (language-based) processing*

### 3. *Triggers* — Marshall Goldsmith ⭐ Best for Professionals and Leaders

**Who it's for:** High-performing professionals who want trigger awareness specifically applied to leadership behaviour, workplace dynamics, and intentional daily practice.

**What it actually covers:**
Goldsmith focuses specifically on *behavioural triggers* — the environmental and social cues that make us act against our better intentions and values. His research with senior executives revealed that even the most self-aware leaders consistently underperform their own stated values under triggering conditions.

His "Daily Questions" practice is practically excellent: 6 structured self-inquiry questions asked every day, scored out of 10. The discipline of daily measurement creates patterns visible weeks before they would otherwise become problems.

**The standout framework:**
The **AIWATT checklist** — "Am I Willing, At This Time, to make the investment required to make a positive difference?" — applied before responding to triggering situations. A simple, memorable filter for the S.T.O.P. moment.

**Key quote:**
> *"The environment is relentless in its demands for us to be someone other than who we want to be."*

### 4. *Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents* — Lindsay C. Gibson ⭐ If Core Wound Tracing points to early family dynamics

**Who it's for:** Adults who consistently find, through Trigger Interview work, that their reactions trace back to dynamics with parents or primary caregivers.

**What it actually covers:**
Gibson explains with remarkable precision how emotionally immature parenting — ranging from critical and dismissive to unpredictable and enmeshed — creates specific, predictable core wounds that become the root system of adult triggers. She is careful not to pathologise parents (most were themselves wounded) while being honest about the impact.

The book is particularly useful for identifying which type of emotionally immature parenting pattern created which specific wound. Gibson's typology (emotional, driven, passive, rejecting) maps cleanly to the core wound categories in the Theory file.

**The section most relevant to trigger work:**
Chapter 5: "How Emotionally Immature Parents Use Their Children to Meet Their Own Needs" — this is where specific adult trigger patterns are traced most clearly to early formation.

## 📱 Apps — How to Use Them for This Concept Specifically

---

### Daylio — Mood & Activity Journal

**What it is:** A micro-journaling app that tracks mood + activities without requiring written entries (uses icons and tags).

**How to use it specifically for trigger work:**

1. Create custom "activities" that correspond to trigger categories (e.g., "criticized at work," "silence from someone," "control situation," "feeling excluded")
2. Log your mood 3–5 times daily
3. After 2 weeks, use the Trends view to see which activity tags correlate with your lowest mood scores
4. These correlations are your trigger pattern data — without requiring 30-minute journal entries

**The benefit for this concept:** The low friction (30 seconds per entry) makes it sustainable. The trend analysis does the pattern-finding work for you visually.

### Insight Timer (Free Tier)

**What it is:** The world's largest free meditation app with 100,000+ guided meditations.

**Specific search terms for trigger work:**

- **"Amygdala hijack meditation"** — 5–10 minute guided practices for S.T.O.P. in the moment
- **"Body scan anxiety"** — for body signal calibration practice
- **"Self-compassion inner child"** — preparation for Core Wound Letter work
- **"Polyvagal nervous system"** — guided vagal tone activation (breathing + posture + sound)

## 🎬 Videos — Specific, Curated, High Impact

---

### "The Amygdala Hijack" — Daniel Goleman (3–8 min clips widely available)

**Search:** "Daniel Goleman amygdala hijack" on YouTube.

Goleman's original explanations of the hijack mechanism are the clearest you will find anywhere. His description of the 480ms gap between amygdala response and prefrontal engagement is both accurate and immediately usable. Watch before starting the S.T.O.P. technique practice.

---

### "How Childhood Trauma Shapes the Adult Brain" — Gabor Maté (TED-style talks, 15–60 min)

**Search:** "Gabor Maté childhood trauma" on YouTube.

Hungarian-Canadian physician and trauma expert Maté's talks explain more clearly than almost anyone else why specific early experiences create specific adult emotional patterns. His compassion-forward framing removes shame from the learning. Directly relevant to Core Wound Tracing work.

---

### "RAIN Meditation for Difficult Emotions" — Tara Brach (20–30 min)

**Search:** "Tara Brach RAIN meditation" on YouTube.

The RAIN practice (Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture) is the best documented meditative approach for sitting with a trigger reaction without suppressing or brooding. Brach guides you through it with precision and warmth.

## 🧠 Therapeutic Frameworks — Explained for Application

---

### Internal Family Systems (IFS) — Richard Schwartz

**What it is:** IFS is a therapeutic model that treats the psyche as a system of "parts" — each with its own perspective, function, and emotional age. Trigger reactions are understood as the activation of a specific "part" — often a protective part trying to prevent a wounded "exile" part from being exposed.

**Why it directly matters for trigger work:**
When your shame trigger fires and you snap at a colleague — from an IFS perspective, that reactive snap is a "manager" or "firefighter" part doing its job of protecting the "exile" (the young you who learned shame was dangerous). The reaction is not pathological. It is a protective system working as designed.

**The IFS insight that changes how you view your triggers:**
Every triggered reaction is a *protective behaviour* from a part of you that is trying to keep a wound safe. Working with the reaction from this lens — with curiosity rather than judgment — accelerates the awareness work.

**How to access:** Read *No Bad Parts* by Richard Schwartz (most accessible entry point). For deep work, an IFS-trained therapist is significantly more effective than solo application.

### Polyvagal Theory — Stephen Porges

**What it is:** Porges' framework identifies three levels of the autonomic nervous system response to threat, mediated by the vagus nerve:

| Level | State | Experience |
|---|---|---|
| **Ventral Vagal** (safe) | Social engagement | Connected, calm, open, curious |
| **Sympathetic** (threat) | Fight or Flight | Anxious, defensive, reactive |
| **Dorsal Vagal** (overwhelm) | Shutdown / Freeze | Collapsed, numb, disconnected, dissociated |

**Why it matters for trigger work:**
Understanding *which level* you drop to in different trigger situations gives you more specific, targeted regulation strategies:

- Fight/Flight responses → Sympathetic state → vagal breathing, cold water, slow movement
- Freeze/Shutdown responses → Dorsal Vagal state → gentle movement, temperature change, social engagement (safe person, gentle voice)

**How to access:** *The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy* by Deb Dana (more accessible than Porges' academic writing). This is the framework used in the S.T.O.P. breathing practice — specifically the extended exhale for vagal activation.
