# 🌍 Real-World Examples — Identifying Personal Triggers

## How to Use These Examples

Read each scenario in two ways:

1. **As a mirror** — does the character's pattern resemble anything in your own experience?
2. **As a case study** — break down the trigger anatomy analytically before reading the analysis

Each example includes: the full scenario with inner monologue, trigger analysis, what a skilled coach would say, and two different outcomes — reactive vs. regulated.

## Example 01 — "You're Being Oversensitive"

**Context:** Senior Software Engineer, post-sprint retrospective meeting.

**What happened:**
Arjun has been working 60-hour weeks on a critical feature. In the retrospective, his team lead Priya mentions that "the team could communicate more proactively about blockers." She doesn't mention anyone by name. Arjun immediately feels a spike of heat in his chest, becomes defensive, and says: "I actually communicate more than most people here." The room goes quiet.

**Inner monologue (what Arjun is experiencing internally):**
> *"She's calling me out. In front of everyone. I've been working twice as hard as anyone else on this team and she's using 'the team' language but everyone knows she means me. They don't see all the work I'm doing. I'm going to look incompetent. This is unfair. I need to defend myself right now or this becomes the narrative about me."*

**Trigger Anatomy:**

| Element | Arjun's Experience |
|---|---|
| **Triggering stimulus** | Priya using general "team" feedback language in a group setting |
| **Body signal** | Heat in chest, jaw tightening |
| **Emotion (precise)** | Shame + injustice/unfairness |
| **Reaction intensity** | 8/10 |
| **Situation severity** | 2/10 (general feedback, no names, no formal consequence) |
| **Gap** | 6 — strong trigger signal |
| **The Story** | "I'm being exposed as inadequate. I must defend immediately." |
| **Core wound** | **Shame wound** — deep fear of being seen as incompetent, likely tied to high-achievement conditioning |

**What a skilled coach would say:**

> *"Arjun, let's separate the two things happening there. One: your actual communication practices — which you have data on and can speak to objectively later if needed. Two: the shame reaction that said 'this is an attack on my competence.' That second thing — that wasn't about Priya's feedback. That was about something much older. What does it bring up for you — that fear of being seen as not working hard enough?"*

**Reactive Outcome:**
Arjun's defensive response creates awkwardness. People now *are* thinking about his communication because he made it impossible not to. The shame gets confirmed rather than bypassed. He spends the rest of the day replaying the conversation.

**Regulated Outcome:**
Arjun catches the chest-heat signal (body scan awareness). He applies S.T.O.P. — a slow breath before speaking. He says nothing in the moment. After the meeting, he checks privately with Priya: "Was there something specific you'd like me to handle differently on blockers?" He gets clear feedback (she wasn't talking about him specifically), and the relationship is preserved.

## Example 02 — The Silent Email

**Context:** Product Manager awaiting feedback from her director on a strategic proposal she spent two weeks on.

**What happened:**
Meera emails a 12-page strategic proposal to her director, Sanjay, on Monday morning. By Friday afternoon — four days later — there has been no reply. Not even a read receipt. Meera has been checking her email obsessively every hour. By Thursday evening, she has drafted three versions of a follow-up email — including one that is quite sharp in tone — and is considering raising it with HR about "communication culture."

**Inner monologue:**
> *"He's had four days. Everyone else he responds to within a day. He's avoiding giving feedback because the proposal is bad. Or he doesn't value what I do. Maybe he's planning to give the project to someone else. I can feel myself getting angry — this is disrespectful. Should I say something? If I say something I'll look needy. If I don't say something I'll look like I have no backbone. Either way I'm going to lose."*

**Trigger Anatomy:**

| Element | Meera's Experience |
|---|---|
| **Triggering stimulus** | Silence / absence of response |
| **Body signal** | Constant checking compulsion; hollow stomach; inability to focus |
| **Emotion (precise)** | Abandonment anxiety + hypervigilance |
| **Reaction intensity** | 8/10 (internal) |
| **Situation severity** | 2/10 (busy director, 4 business days, no indication of problem) |
| **Gap** | 6 — strong trigger |
| **The Story** | "Silence = rejection. If I'm not being responded to, I am not valued." |
| **Core wound** | **Abandonment wound** — silence was dangerous in early environment; learned to equate non-response with withdrawal of care |

**What a skilled coach would say:**

> *"Meera, 4 days from a director is genuinely within normal range — and yet your system is interpreting it like a life threat. That gap tells us something important. Can you tell me: in your experience, what has 'silence from someone important' typically meant? Not intellectually — in your gut, from as early as you can remember?"*

**Reactive Outcome:**
Meera sends the sharp follow-up email on Friday evening. Sanjay, who had been in back-to-back board preparation sessions all week, sees it on Saturday. The relationship is quietly altered — she is now viewed as "difficult to work with under pressure." The proposal, ironically, is excellent.

**Regulated Outcome:**
Meera recognises the hollow-stomach signal as her abandonment trigger. She states aloud to herself: "My rule: I will not interpret silence as rejection for 5 business days on a strategic proposal." She sends one professional, non-pressuring follow-up on Day 5: "Just checking — is there a good time this week to walk through my proposal?" Sanjay responds: "Sorry — completely buried. Loved it. Can we meet Monday?"

## Example 03 — The Micromanager's Comments

**Context:** Senior developer receiving a pull request review.

**What happened:**
Rayan submits a pull request for a significant API refactor. His team lead, Farhan, adds 34 inline comments over two hours. Most are valid technical suggestions. But Farhan also adds 8 comments on naming conventions and code style — things Rayan knows are subjective. Rayan reads the first 5 comments, feels his blood pressure rise, and closes the laptop. He tells his colleague: "I'm done. I'm not going to keep working on a team where nothing I do is ever good enough."

**Inner monologue:**
> *"34 comments. THIRTY-FOUR. I've been doing this for 7 years and he's questioning my variable names? My architectural decisions? He doesn't trust me at all. What's the point of working at an expert level if someone is going to nitpick everything? This is humiliating. I can't work like this. Maybe I should just leave. I'm not respected here."*

**Trigger Anatomy:**

| Element | Rayan's Experience |
|---|---|
| **Triggering stimulus** | High-volume, partially stylistic code review |
| **Body signal** | Rising blood pressure; urge to close laptop / physically leave |
| **Emotion (precise)** | Humiliation + powerlessness |
| **Reaction intensity** | 9/10 |
| **Situation severity** | 4/10 (code review with both valid and stylistic comments — solvable) |
| **Gap** | 5 — strong trigger |
| **The Story** | "My competence is being publicly dismissed. Nothing I do is good enough and I have no control." |
| **Core wound** | **Powerlessness + humiliation wound** — likely conditioned by a controlling environment where effort was examined critically and autonomy was denied |

**What a skilled coach would say:**

> *"You said 'nothing I do is ever good enough.' Is that actually what Farhan said — or is that the story your nervous system added? What does 'nothing is ever good enough' remind you of? That's a sentence with a very specific weight to it."*

*Then, practically:*

> *"Here's what is actually solvable: You can separate the 26 valid technical comments from the 8 stylistic ones. You can have a conversation about team standards so expectations are explicit. The real question is — can you address the work problem without carrying the full emotional weight of the wound into it?"*

**Reactive Outcome:**
Rayan vents to two colleagues (who now see him as emotionally reactive). He sends a passive-aggressive reply to Farhan's review. The relationship sours. His "I'm done" comment circulates and reaches his manager informally. His career trajectory on this team is affected.

**Regulated Outcome:**
Rayan takes 30 minutes away from the screen (cortisol clearance). He returns, categorises comments into "functional changes" and "stylistic preferences." He addresses all functional comments and replies calmly: "I've addressed the functional items. On conventions — can we schedule 20 minutes to align on team style standards so we have a shared baseline going forward?" Farhan agrees. The relationship deepens.

## Example 04 — The Colleague Who Got Promoted

**Context:** Engineering lead learning a peer was promoted to Principal level.

**What happened:**
Keerthi and Sundar joined the company on the same day, three years ago. Both are strong engineers. On Friday, Keerthi hears via the office Slack that Sundar has been promoted to Principal Engineer. Keerthi has not been told anything. Over the weekend, Keerthi becomes bitter, sullen, and begins actively withholding collaboration from Sundar. She stops responding to his Slack messages. By Monday, she has started exploring job openings at competitor companies.

**Inner monologue:**
> *"Why him and not me? We have the same tenure. My code quality is arguably better. Is it because I'm a woman? Is it because I don't play politics? Nobody talked to me about this. Nobody even told me. I'm invisible here. I've been invisible my whole career. They see him and they don't see me. Fine. I'll go somewhere that sees me."*

**Trigger Anatomy:**

| Element | Keerthi's Experience |
|---|---|
| **Triggering stimulus** | Peer's promotion announcement; absence of any acknowledgment of her own standing |
| **Body signal** | Heaviness in chest; withdrawal energy (folding inward) |
| **Emotion (precise)** | Exclusion + invisibility + grief |
| **Reaction intensity** | 9/10 |
| **Situation severity** | 5/10 (a real professional situation worth addressing — but not career-ending or confirming she won't advance) |
| **Gap** | 4 — significant trigger overlaying a real situation |
| **The Story** | "I am invisible. Others are seen; I am overlooked. This is the story of my life, confirmed again." |
| **Core wound** | **Rejection + invisibility wound** — possibly the overlooked sibling, the child whose achievements were unmarked, the person conditioned to believe that effort alone is not enough |

**What a skilled coach would say:**

> *"Two things are true simultaneously here. One: it is entirely reasonable to want clarity about your own progression, and it's worth having that conversation with your manager. Two: the jump to 'I'm invisible, this is the story of my life' — that's the wound talking, not the data. What do you know, actually, about why this promotion happened and what your own path looks like? Until you ask, you are filling silence with a story. And the story you're filling it with is a very old, very painful one."*

**Reactive Outcome:**
Keerthi withdraws from Sundar and the team. Her diminished collaboration becomes visible to leadership — exactly the behaviour that would differentiate a Principal candidate from a Senior. She leaves for a competitor 3 months later without getting clarity. The promotion wound reinforces: "I'm never seen."

**Regulated Outcome:**
Keerthi gives herself the weekend to feel the emotion without acting on it. By Monday, she schedules a career conversation with her manager: "I saw Sundar's announcement. I'd love to understand — what does a path to Principal look like for me specifically? What am I missing?" She gets clear, actionable criteria. She learns she is 12 months from the conversation. Her informed focus replaces the invisible-wound narrative.

## Example 05 — The Group Chat Left-Out

**Context:** A team activity is organised without including one team member.

**What happened:**
Deepak discovers, on Monday, that four of his closest colleagues organised a weekend lunch together using the team Slack — and didn't invite him. He wasn't contacted. He sees the photos in the chat on Monday morning. He feels winded — literally cannot breathe for a moment. He says nothing all day, goes home, and tells his partner he's thinking of quitting the job.

**Inner monologue:**
> *"They did it deliberately. They don't actually like me. I always suspected I was tolerated here, not actually included. I'm the outsider. It's always been like this — somehow everyone else understands the rules of belonging and I never do. What's wrong with me that I'm always the one left out?"*

**Trigger Anatomy:**

| Element | Deepak's Experience |
|---|---|
| **Triggering stimulus** | Seeing photos of a group event he was not invited to |
| **Body signal** | Winded sensation; chest emptiness |
| **Emotion (precise)** | Exclusion + deep loneliness + shame ("What is wrong with me?") |
| **Reaction intensity** | 10/10 |
| **Situation severity** | 3/10 (likely a semi-spontaneous lunch, no malice, not a work decision) |
| **Gap** | 7 — very strong trigger |
| **The Story** | "I am fundamentally excluded. Something about who I am makes me the one who is left out." |
| **Core wound** | **Rejection + abandonment wound** — childhood exclusion (class, family, peer group) has been encoded as factual truth about his social worth |

**What a skilled coach would say:**

> *"That reaction — winded, thinking about quitting over a lunch — tells us this is not really about that lunch. That lunch touched something that has been in your system for a very long time. Let's find out what. When is the first time you remember feeling exactly like this — that specific feeling of 'I'm the one left out, there's something wrong with me?'"*

*Then, practically:*
> *"And while we work on that — what do you actually know about why you weren't included? Have you considered that it may have been genuinely unintentional? What would it take to test that assumption before making a major career decision based on it?"*

**Regulated Outcome:**
Deepak names the wound ("This is my exclusion trigger — not a group decision about my worth"). He reaches out casually: "Saw the lunch photos — looked fun! I'm always keen to join these." A colleague replies immediately: "We thought you had plans with your family that weekend! We actually wanted you there." His system resets because he chose truth-testing over wound-confirmation.

## Example 06 — The Stakeholder Who Publicly Challenges

**Context:** Engineering Manager presenting a technical roadmap to senior leadership.

**What happened:**
Shruti is presenting a 6-month roadmap to a VP-level audience. Midway through her second slide, the CTO says: "Wait — did anyone actually think this through technically, or are we just proposing things to propose things?" The room goes very quiet. Shruti freezes for 3 seconds, then begins over-explaining at length — details nobody asked for, rambling, losing her thread — for the next 8 minutes. By the time she finishes, she has undermined every key point on the slide.

**Inner monologue (during the freeze):**
> *"My mind went blank. Completely blank. He's going to destroy this. Everyone here is going to side with him. I'm going to look incompetent. They're all looking at me. Say something. Say anything. Why can't I think?! Just talk. Just talk. Keep talking. Maybe if I give enough detail they'll see it was thought through. No wait — I'm rambling. Stop. You're making it worse."*

**Trigger Anatomy:**

| Element | Shruti's Experience |
|---|---|
| **Triggering stimulus** | Public challenge to her competence by a senior authority figure |
| **Body signal** | Freeze response; mind-blank; voice constriction |
| **Emotion (precise)** | Shame + fear of exposure |
| **Reaction intensity** | 10/10 |
| **Situation severity** | 5/10 (a hard challenge, but answerable — she *had* thought it through thoroughly) |
| **Gap** | 5 — significant trigger overlay |
| **The Story** | "I'm being exposed as incompetent. Authority has the power to nullify me publicly." |
| **Core wound** | **Shame + humiliation wound** — likely early conditioned through high-critical evaluators (parent, teacher) who questioned her competence in front of others |

**Regulated Response (what mastery looks like):**
Having identified this trigger pattern previously, Shruti has a practiced response for exactly this type of challenge. She had rehearsed: *"When someone challenges my work in public, I pause, breathe, and address the specific question — not all of my anxiety."*

She pauses two seconds. Takes one visible breath. Looks at the CTO without defensiveness: *"That's exactly the right challenge. Let me walk you through the three technical assumptions this roadmap is built on — and flag where I still believe we have open questions."* She addresses the actual question, not her shame.

The CTO nods. "That's what I wanted to hear — carry on."
