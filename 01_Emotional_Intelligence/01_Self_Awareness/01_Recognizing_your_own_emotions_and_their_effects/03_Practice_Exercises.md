## ⚡ Exercise 1 — Emotion Word Swap (Daily, 1 min)

**Goal:** Build emotional vocabulary — stop using vague words like "fine", "okay", "stressed".

**How to do it:**
> Every time you are about to say **"I'm fine"** or **"I'm stressed"** — pause and replace it with a more precise word.

**Practice right now:**

Replace each vague word below with 3 more precise alternatives:

| Vague Word | Your Precise Alternatives |
|---|---|
| Fine | ___________ / ___________ / ___________ |
| Stressed | ___________ / ___________ / ___________ |
| Upset | ___________ / ___________ / ___________ |
| Good | ___________ / ___________ / ___________ |

*(Reference answers: Fine → Content/Relieved/Neutral | Stressed → Overwhelmed/Anxious/Pressured)*

**Set 3 phone alarms:** Morning (9am) | Afternoon (2pm) | Evening (8pm)

When the alarm goes off, answer these 3 questions:

```
1. PAUSE — What am I physically feeling right now?
   → Head? Shoulders? Chest? Stomach? Hands?
   
2. NAME IT — What emotion matches this sensation?
   → _______________________________________________
   
3. TRACE IT — What event/thought triggered this?
   → _______________________________________________
```

> ✅ **Success marker:** After 2 weeks, you should start noticing emotions *without* needing the alarm.

    People
      Who makes me feel anxious?
      Who makes me feel resentful?
      Who energizes me?
    Situations
      What meeting types drain me?
      What tasks cause dread?
    Words/Phrases

    Times/Places
      Morning vs Evening mood?

## ⚡ Exercise 5 — The Mirror Exercise (Weekly, 5 min)

**Goal:** Recognize emotions through facial expressions — your own and others'.

**How:**

1. Sit quietly in front of a mirror (or use your phone camera)
2. Think of a recent event that triggered an emotion
3. **Observe your face** — what does the emotion look like on you?
4. Practice **consciously labeling** the expression: "This is what my frustration looks like"

> 💡 **Why this works:** Most people have never observed their own emotional expressions. This builds the muscle of recognizing subtle cues — both in yourself and later in others.
