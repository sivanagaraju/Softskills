## 🎯 Self-Assessment Quiz — Where Are You Right Now?

Rate yourself honestly on each statement from **1 to 5**:

- **1** = Almost never | **2** = Rarely | **3** = Sometimes | **4** = Often | **5** = Almost always

| # | Statement | Your Score (1–5) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | I can name what I am feeling with a precise emotion word (not just "fine" or "stressed") | |
| 2 | I notice emotions in my body before they escalate | |
| 3 | I can tell the difference between a thought ("I feel like you don't care") and an emotion ("I feel dismissed") | |
| 4 | I recognize when an emotion is influencing my decisions or behavior in the moment | |
| 5 | I can identify the specific trigger that caused an emotion, not just the emotion itself | |
| 6 | I notice subtle, low-intensity emotions (mild anxiety, quiet excitement) not just peak ones | |
| 7 | I observe my emotions without judging myself for having them | |
| **TOTAL** | | **/35** |
