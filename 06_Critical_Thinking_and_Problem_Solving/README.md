# 🧠 Critical Thinking and Problem Solving Learning Path

Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information. It is the core of effective problem solving, allowing you to move beyond surface-level symptoms to find root-cause solutions.

## 📁 Sub-Folder Overview

### [01_Foundations_of_Critical_Thinking](./01_Foundations_of_Critical_Thinking)

**Objective:** Understanding the "Standard" of good thinking.

- Intellectual standards: Clarity, Accuracy, Precision, Relevance, Depth, and Breadth.
- Asking clarifying questions.
- Distinguishing between facts, opinions, and assumptions.

### [02_Logic_and_Reasoning_Patterns](./02_Logic_and_Reasoning_Patterns)

**Objective:** Building sound arguments and detecting flawed ones.

- **Inductive vs. Deductive Reasoning:** Moving from specific to general and vice-versa.
- **Logical Fallacies:** Identifying common errors in reasoning (Ad Hominem, Straw Man, Slippery Slope).
- **First Principles Thinking:** Breaking down complex problems into basic elements and rebuilding them.

### [03_Problem_Identification_and_Analysis](./03_Problem_Identification_and_Analysis)

**Objective:** Correcting the right problem before trying to solve it.

- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** The "5 Whys" technique.
- **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagrams:** Visualizing cause and effect.
- **Problem Framing:** How the way you state a problem determines the solution.

### [04_Creative_Thinking_and_Ideation](./04_Creative_Thinking_and_Ideation)

**Objective:** Generating novel and useful solutions.

- **Divergent vs. Convergent Thinking:** Expanding possibilities before narrowing them down.
- **Brainstorming and Mind Mapping:** Techniques for group and individual ideation.
- **Lateral Thinking (SCAMPER):** Tools for looking at problems from new angles.

### [05_Overcoming_Cognitive_Biases](./05_Overcoming_Cognitive_Biases)

**Objective:** Identifying the mental "shortcuts" that lead to errors.

- **Confirmation Bias:** Searching for what we already believe.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing an endeavor because of past investment.
- **Availability Heuristic:** Overestimating information that is easy to remember.

### [06_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Validation](./06_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Validation)

**Objective:** Ensuring your solution works in the real world.

- Developing testable hypotheses.
- **A/B Testing:** Comparing two versions to see which performs better.
- Iterative cycles: Build, Measure, Learn.

### [07_Systems_Thinking](./07_Systems_Thinking)

**Objective:** Understanding how parts interact within a whole.

- Feedback loops (Reinforcing and Balancing).
- Identifying "Leverage Points" where a small change can lead to a large shift.
- Avoiding "Unintended Consequences."
