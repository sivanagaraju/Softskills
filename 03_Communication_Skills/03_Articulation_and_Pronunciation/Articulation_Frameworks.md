# Articulation Frameworks & Mental Models

Mastering articulation isn't just about vocabulary; it's about structure. These frameworks help organize your thoughts *before* you speak, ensuring clarity, brevity, and impact.

## 1. PREP: The Classic Structure

**Best for**: Impromptu speaking, answering specific questions, giving opinions.

* **P - Point**: State your main idea or answer immediately. Don't bury the lead.
* **R - Reason**: Explain *why* you believe this. Give the logic.
* **E - Example**: Provide evidence, a story, or data to support your reason. (This makes it memorable).
* **P - Point**: Restate your main point to conclude.

> **Example**: "I believe remote work is the future (Point). It allows for greater flexibility and productivity (Reason). My team's output increased by 20% after switching to a hybrid model (Example). Therefore, we should embrace remote work policies (Point)."

## 2. GPS / GPTS: The Problem Solver

**Best for**: Explaining "How-to" processes, proposing solutions, or giving advice.

* **G - Goal**: What are we trying to achieve?
* **P - Problem**: What is stopping us? What is the main hurdle?
* **S - Solution (or 3 Steps)**: How do we overcome it? (Break this down into 1-2-3 actionable steps).

> **Example**: "You want to lose weight (Goal). But you struggle with consistency in diet (Problem). The solution is to meal prep on Sundays, remove junk food from the house, and track your calories (Solution/Steps)."

## 3. CARE: The Storyteller (Behavioral Interviews)

**Best for**: Answering "Tell me about a time when..." or sharing professional achievements.

* **C - Context**: Set the scene. "We were facing a deadline..."
* **A - Action**: What did *you* specifically do? "I organized a daily stand-up..."
* **R - Result**: What was the outcome? "We delivered 2 days early..."
* **E - Evolution**: What did you learn? "I learned that communication is key..."

## 4. PPF: The Timeline

**Best for**: Introductions, "Tell me about yourself", explaining trends or history.

* **P - Past**: Where you started or how things used to be.
* **P - Present**: Where you are now or the current state.
* **F - Future**: Where you are going or the vision ahead.

> **Example**: "I started as a junior dev (Past). I'm currently leading the backend team (Present). I aim to transition into system architecture (Future)."

## 5. ADS: The Balanced View

**Best for**: Discussing complex topics, analyzing options, or showing critical thinking.

* **A - Advantages**: The pros. "AI can automate mundane tasks..."
* **D - Disadvantages**: The cons. "However, it poses privacy risks..."
* **S - Summary/Synthesis**: Your final take. "Therefore, we need regulation to balance innovation with safety."

## 6. What - Why - What Next

**Best for**: Persuasion and driving action.

* **What**: What is the idea or proposal?
* **Why**: Why does it matter? Why now?
* **What Next**: Call to action. What should the audience do?

## 7. CQC: The Articulate Asker

**Best for**: Asking high-quality questions in meetings or interviews.

* **C - Credibility**: Start with a compliment or observation about the person's work.
* **Q - Question**: Ask your specific question.
* **C - Context**: Provide the reason *why* you are asking (evidence, background).

> **Example**: "You've successfully led the team through two market crashes (Credibility). How do you handle high-pressure environments (Question)? I ask because our team is currently facing a tight deadline and morale is low (Context)."

## 8. CIK: The First Minute (Emails/Starts)

**Best for**: Starting a conversation, sending a cold email, or pitching.

* **C - Context**: What are we talking about?
* **I - Intent**: Why am I talking to you?
* **K - Key Message**: The headline/main point.

> **Example**: "Context: Regarding the Q3 Marketing Report. Intent: I need your approval on the budget. Key Message: We are overspending by 10% and need to cut costs immediately."

## 9. Advanced Framing Techniques

### Framing with Evidence

State a piece of evidence *before* asking a question.
> **Instead of**: "Should we extend the deadline?"
> **Try**: "We have seen 3 dependencies delayed and the client added 2 requirements (Evidence). Given that, should we extend the deadline?"

### Contrast Framing

Highlight a contrast to make the achievement pop.
> **Template**: "For someone like you (Contrast/Identity), who did (Challenge/Achievement), what was it like?"
> **Example**: "For a fiction writer like you, to write a biography of a tech mogul, what was that like?"

### Comparison Hook

Compare the person/situation to something famous or vivid.
> **Example**: "You are the Rahul Dravid to his Sehwag - the anchor to his explosion."
> **Small Talk Example**: "Are you a 'Netflix and Chill' person or a 'Weekend Warrior'?"

## 10. CAD: The Storytelling Response

**Best for**: Answering questions with depth using storytelling, showcasing knowledge.

* **C - Context**: Provide background before your answer to establish credibility.
* **A - Answer**: State your actual answer or position.
* **D - Details**: Elaborate with specifics, data, or examples.

> **Example** (Shashi Tharoor style): "There are three historical precedents for this (Context). So it is, in that sense, not unprecedented (Answer). We sent out 58 MPs to seven regions, covering eight states and five parties (Details)."

## 11. CARA: Concise Speech

**Best for**: Giving brief, structured verbal responses.

* **C - Context**: Set the scene in one sentence.
* **A - Answer**: Give your direct answer.
* **R - Reference**: Cite a supporting example or source.
* **A - Answer**: Restate/refine your answer with the reference in mind.

## 12. ACCR: Guest Speaker Introductions

**Best for**: Introducing a speaker at an event, podcast, or meeting.

* **A - Agenda**: What will the speaker talk about? Set the topic.
* **C - Credentials**: Why should we listen? Share their achievements.
* **C - Connection**: Share a personal anecdote or story about the speaker.
* **R - Reveal**: Save their name for last for maximum impact.

> **Pro Tips**: Give the speaker a nickname before the reveal ("the clarity whisperer"). Consider using a short video or props to make the introduction memorable.

## 13. The Through Line (Golden Rule of Storytelling)

**Best for**: Presentations, TED-style talks, pitches.

From Chris Anderson (TED): Define your main message in **one sentence**. Every story, fact, and example must serve this through line. If it doesn't, cut it.

> **Example**: The through line of "The Paradox of Choice" is: *More choice actually makes us less happy.* Every anecdote in the talk reinforces this single idea.

## 14. The Respond-and-Ask Technique

**Best for**: Avoiding "interview mode" in conversations.

Instead of asking question after question, **respond with a statement first**, then ask your next question. This creates natural flow.

> **Instead of**: "Where did you go?" → "How was it?" → "What did you eat?"
> **Try**: "Oh, a road trip to Goa! I did that in college and fell in love with the journey itself. Did you feel the same, or was it more about the destination?"

## 15. The Rule of Three

**Best for**: Persuasion, emails, pitches, presentations.

Speak in groups of three. Three is the smallest number to create a pattern, and humans love patterns.

> **Classic**: "I came, I saw, I conquered." / "Government of the people, by the people, for the people."
> **Workplace**: "This tool will save us time, reduce errors, and make collaboration effortless."

## Mental Habits for Articulation

### The Objective Rule (North Star)

Every conversation has a goal (inform, persuade, entertain, connect). Identify it before you speak. If you wander, ask yourself: "Does this serve the objective?"

### The 3-2-1 Trick (For Interrupting/Commanding)

1. **Pause for 3 Seconds**: Silence grabs attention.
2. **Give 2 Points**: Limit your argument to two key points (Visual + Verbal track).
3. **End with 1 Question**: Passes the ball back and engages the listener ("What do you think?").

### Segmented Speech (Sprints)

Speak in **5-10 second bursts**. Humans have short attention spans (like TikTok). Pause. Let it land. Then continue. Don't monologue.

### The "I Spy" Game

Practice articulation daily:

1. Look around and pick an object (e.g., a clock),
2. Immediately tell a 30-second story or memory associated with it.
3. This trains your brain to link *objects* to *experiences* instantly.

### The Communication Buddy System

Find one person (friend, colleague, family member) for daily 5-minute calls:

1. Give each other a **random topic**.
2. Speak on it for **1-2 minutes** immediately (no prep).
3. Give **30-60 seconds of feedback**.
4. Swap roles. End the call.

*Consistency over intensity. This builds impromptu speaking muscle faster than any framework.*

## Rhetorical Devices & Linguistic Tools

### Antithesis (Contrast for Impact)

Draw a contrast between two opposing ideas in one statement. This adds punch and memorability.

> **Classic**: "Judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character." — MLK
> **Workplace**: "We are the engineering team, not the firefighting team."
> **Political**: "The United States of America, not the Divided States of America." — Obama

### The Power of Anecdotes

Don't leave a point hanging in the air. Support important points with short memorable stories (anecdotes). Not every point — just the ones that matter most.

> **Practice**: Start with friends and family in low-pressure conversations. When making a point, back it up with "Let me tell you about the time…"
> **Why**: A list of logical reasons will never convince as well as one vivid personal story. (Priyanka Chopra technique.)

### Visual Speaking (Perceptual Language)

Replace vague descriptions with words that help people *see* what you're saying.

> **Vague**: "The product demo went well."
> **Visual**: "As we showed each feature, you could see the client's face light up — the smile got bigger and bigger."

*Obama and Priyanka Chopra both use this instinctively.*

### "I've Observed" vs "I Think" (Columbia University)

Statements framed as observations are rated **40% more credible** than statements framed as opinions.

> **Weak**: "I think our process is inefficient."
> **Strong**: "I've observed that our process takes 3x longer than the industry average."

## Practice Systems

### The 14-Day Articulation Boot Camp

A structured daily drill to build articulation muscle:

1. Pick **1 topic** you know well.
2. Generate **14 questions** about it.
3. Daily routine:
   * 2 vocal warm-ups (lip trills, humming).
   * Record yourself answering 1 question using the GPS framework.
   * Self-evaluate the recording.
   * Re-record.
   * Re-evaluate. Repeat daily.

### The Communication Mirror (Self-Assessment System)

A comprehensive 4-step self-review process (9 minutes/week):

1. **Record**: Record a 5-min impromptu video answering ChatGPT-generated questions. (Hack: Print a photo of your best friend and place it above the camera.)
2. **Wait 24 Hours**: Don't review immediately — your ego is still in the driver's seat. After 24h, you shift to "observer mode."
3. **Vocal Review**: Turn phone screen-down, volume up. Listen ONLY. Note: pitch patterns, filler words, believability, pauses, energy.
4. **Visual Review**: Turn phone screen-up, volume DOWN (muted). Watch ONLY. Note: eye movement, default gestures, facial expression, body language.
5. **Verbal Review**: Transcribe the video (keep filler words). Read the transcript. Analyze with AI. Note: sentence clarity, repeated words, structure.

### The 12-Week Improvement Plan

Take ALL notes from the Communication Mirror and build a custom plan:

1. **Week 1**: Pick **ONE behavior** to improve (from vocal, visual, or verbal). Focus ONLY on that.
2. **End of week**: Record and review a new 5-min video. Did you improve?
3. **If yes**: Move to the next behavior.
4. **If no**: Repeat the same behavior next week. (A CEO of Orangetheory Fitness spent 4 weeks on volume alone before progressing.)
5. **Never focus on more than 1 thing per week.** When you focus on 10 things, nothing improves.

*This isn't a 12-week plan. It's a lifelong system that takes 9 minutes a week.*

### Cognitive Close (End with Authority)

End conversations, presentations, and meetings with a **recommendation**, not a question.

> **Weak**: "So, what do you guys think? Let me know..."
> **Strong**: "Here's what I recommend we do next: [action]."

### The McKinsey Method (Situation-Complication-Resolution)

A classic consultancy framework for structured communication:

* **S - Situation**: What is the current state of things?
* **C - Complication**: What has changed or what is the problem?
* **R - Resolution**: What should we do about it?

> **Tip**: GPS (Goal-Problem-Solution) evolved from this. Use whichever feels more natural.
